   Given a histogram file, we want to find the 5 most similar images to that histogram in a directory.
     - Compare the histogram of the query to each histogram in the directory
     - Output the 5 most similar images to the given query

;; normalize-all-histograms
;; Normalizes a list of histograms by using normalize-histogram on each.
;; Parameters:
;;   list files - list of histograms to be normalized.
;; Output:
;;   Normalized histograms as a list.

;; normalize-histogram
;; Normalizes a histogram by dividing each element by the total count.
;; Parameters:
;;   list histogram - A histogram in the form of a list.
;; Output:
;;   Normalized histograms as a list.
(define (normalize-histogram histogram)
  (define total (apply + histogram)) ; Calculate the total count of pixels in the histogram

(define (get-all-files directory)
  (define files (directory-list directory));gives a list of files in the form of their filepath
  (let ((full-paths (map (lambda (file) (build-path directory file)) files)));replace all files by the full path by using the directory name and the file name
    (map list (map path->string full-paths) (normalize-all-histograms (process-files (map path->string full-paths))))));we take all the paths, turn them to a list of strings,
